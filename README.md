## Project notes
```

### JavaScript test
```
Script to validate and then reverse a binary number, returning it along with its corresponding integer. 
I created the script with browser execution in mind so there is probably more validation than necessary.


### PHP test
```
Script to simulate an abstract file system, given certain Bash commands. This took me an embarrassingly long time. 
My mistake was to wrongly imagine that, after moving up in the file tree, the Class would need to retain a full track
of previously declared child directories. However, that's not the case. If you do 
`cd ../../` from `a/b/c/d/x` you cannot get back to `x` without redeclaring it.

Once I figured that out it was a lot easier.


### Python test
```
I've never used Python so I did not complete this section. My apologies. I did look at getting an IDE and trying the
task anyway, but it would just be me copying and pasting from StackOverflow, so I didn't think that would be very 
useful or appreciated.

**Thank you for considering my work.**
